## Potion Miscibility

> **VARIANT: MIXING POTIONS**
> A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another, or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.
> When a character mixes two potions together, you can roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.

A potion has no effect if it can’t be halved in this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|            36–90             | Both potions work normally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|            91–99             | The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|              00              | Only one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a potion of healing might increase the drinker’s hit point maximum by 4, or oil of etherealness might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, might end this lasting effect. |

| :-: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 force damage per level of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  2  | The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby if the caster was the intended target.                                                                                                                      |
|  3  | The spell affects a random location within the spell’s range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  4  | The spell’s effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold.                                                                                                                                         |
|  5  | The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell’s duration, or 1d10 minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, a fireball might cause smoke to billow from the caster’s ears for 1d10 minutes. |
|  6  | The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell’s maximum range, if the target has moved away.    |

## Lingering Injuries

| :-------------------------: | :--------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|              1              | Lose an Eye.           | You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you’re blinded.                                                                                    |
|              2              | Lose an Arm or a Hand. | You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage.                                                                                                                                                       |
|              3              | Lose a Foot or Leg.    | Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage.                          |
|              4              | Limp.                  | Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.                                                                                                                                |
|             5–7             | Internal Injury.       | Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can’t use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.                          |
|            8–10             | Broken Ribs.           | This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|            11–13            | Horrible Scar.         | You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can’t be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar.                                                  |
|            14–16            | Festering Wound.       | Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
|            17–20            | Minor Scar.            | The scar doesn’t have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

> Instead of using the effect described in the table, you can put the responsibility of representing a character’s lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering the effect described for that result, that character gains a new flaw with the same name. It’s up to the player to express the lingering injury during play, just like any other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when the injury affects the character in a meaningful way.

|            31–40             | The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.                                                                      |
|            41–45             | The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.                                                                                                          |

|            76–85             | The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |
|            86–90             | Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.            |
|            91–95             | The character loses the ability to speak.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|            96–100            | The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.                                                                                                                                             |

|            51–55             | "I don’t like the way people judge me all the time."                                                                                     |

> **Curing Madness**
> A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil and good might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
