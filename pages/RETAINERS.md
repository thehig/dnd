# Retainers

> Based on [Strongholds and Followers by Matt Colville and co](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/)

- Must be of a lower level than the PC they are following
- Are not PCs
- Follow the PCs orders, do not take the lead
- Should be easy to run

## Basic Mechanics

- Act on their Leader (PCs) initiative
- Don't have hit points, rather a number of __health levels__ equal to their level
- Regain 1 __health level__ per short rest
- Each die of healing recovers one __health level__
- When hit instead of taking damage retainer makes a CONSAV DC equal to the average attack damage
  - Succeed: Take no damage
  - Fail: Lose one __health level__ per die of damage
- AC is one of three:
  - Light: 13
  - Medium: 15
  - Heavy: 18
- Has the same gear as a starting PC of their class
- Level up once per two levels their PC levels up
- Maximum of 7th level
- Gain special actions at 5th and 7th level
- Perception, movement and special abilities are determined by Ancestry

## Checks and Saves

- Has one primary ability and various skills
- +3 to ability checks
  - additional +1 to primary ability checks
  - additional +2 to proficient skill checks
- Saving Throws
  - default to +3
  - additional +3 to proficient saves
  - Success: lose __health levels__ equal to Â½ spell level
  - Fail: lose __health levels__ equal to spell level

## Actions

- All the regular actions (move, act, react, bonus, opportunity attacks)
- One **signature attack** that can be used once per turn
  - If granted extra attacks, signature attack is always used
  - At 7th level retainers can make 2 signature attacks per turn
- Higher level retainers get **special actions** usable once per 10 minutes and a max number of times per day
- Attacking
  - If the PC hits, the follower hits with their signature attack (even vs different targets)
  - If the PC misses or doesn't attack, _then_ make an attack roll for the follower
    - For these purposes spells that deal damage or induce a saving throw count as an attack
  - Attacks with +6 to hit (or spell attack)
    - Optional +1 at 5th and 7th level
- Spells and DCs
  - Level 3: DC 13
  - Level 5: DC 14
  - Level 7: DC 15
