## Potion Miscibility

> **VARIANT: MIXING POTIONS**
> A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another, or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.
> When a character mixes two potions together, you can roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.

| d100	| Result |
| :-: | :-- |
| 01	| The mixture creates a magical explosion, dealing 6d10 force damage to the mixer and 1d10 force damage to each creature within 5 feet of the mixer. |
| 02–08	| The mixture becomes an ingested poison of the DM’s choice. |
| 09–15	| Both potions lose their effects. |
| 16–25	| One potion loses its effect. |
| 26–35	| Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. A potion has no effect if it can’t be halved in this way. |
| 36–90	| Both potions work normally. |
| 91–99	| The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. |
| 00	| Only one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a potion of healing might increase the drinker’s hit point maximum by 4, or oil of etherealness might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, might end this lasting effect. |

## Scroll Mishap

> **VARIANT: SCROLL MISHAPS**
> A creature who tries and fails to cast a spell from a spell scroll must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. If the saving throw fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap table.

| d6 |	Result |
| :-: | :-- |
| 1 |	A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 force damage per level of the spell. |
| 2 |	The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby if the caster was the intended target. |
| 3 |	The spell affects a random location within the spell’s range. |
| 4 |	The spell’s effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold. |
| 5 |	The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell’s duration, or 1d10 minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, a fireball might cause smoke to billow from the caster’s ears for 1d10 minutes. |
| 6 |	The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell’s maximum range, if the target has moved away. |

## Lingering Injury

| d20 |	Injury | |
| :-: | :-- | --- |
| 1	| Lose an Eye. | You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you’re blinded. |
| 2	| Lose an Arm or a Hand. | You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 3	| Lose a Foot or Leg. | Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 4	| Limp. | Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp. |
| 5–7	| Internal Injury. | Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can’t use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting. |
| 8–10	| Broken Ribs. | This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10. |
| 11–13	| Horrible Scar. | You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can’t be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar. |
| 14–16	| Festering Wound. | Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
| 17–20	| Minor Scar. | The scar doesn’t have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar. |

> Instead of using the effect described in the table, you can put the responsibility of representing a character’s lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering the effect described for that result, that character gains a new flaw with the same name. It’s up to the player to express the lingering injury during play, just like any other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when the injury affects the character in a meaningful way.

# Madness

## Short-Term Madness

| d100 |	Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes) |
| :-: | :-- |
| 01–20 |	The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage. |
| 21–30 |	The character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping. |
| 31–40 |	The character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear. |
| 41–50 |	The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech or spellcasting. |
| 51–60 |	The character must use his or her action each round to attack the nearest creature. |
| 61–70 |	The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. |
| 71–75 |	The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn’t obviously self-destructive. |
| 76–80 |	The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. |
| 81–90 |	The character is stunned. |
| 91–100 |	The character falls unconscious. |

## Long-Term Madness

| d100 |	Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours)
| :-: | :-- |
| 01–10 |	The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins. |
| 11–20 |	The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. |
| 21–30 |	The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks. |
| 31–40 |	The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. |
| 41–45 |	The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects. |
| 46–55 |	The character becomes attached to a "lucky charm," such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. |
| 56–65 |	The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). |
| 66–75 |	The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity. |
| 76–85 |	The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |
| 86–90 |	Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute. |
| 91–95 |	The character loses the ability to speak. |
| 96–100 |	The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character. |

## Indefinite Madness

| d100 |	Flaw (lasts until cured) |
| :-: | :-- |
| 01–15 |	"Being drunk keeps me sane." |
| 16–25 |	"I keep whatever I find." |
| 26–30 |	"I try to become more like someone else I know — adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name." |
| 31–35 |	"I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people." |
| 36–45 |	"Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll ignore everything else to pursue it." |
| 46–50 |	"I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me." |
| 51–55 |	"I don’t like the way people judge me all the time." |
| 56–70 |	"I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know." |
| 71–80 |	"I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the time." |
| 81–85 |	"There’s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend." |
| 86–95 |	"I can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it." |
| 96–100 |	"I’ve discovered that I really like killing people." |

> **Curing Madness**
> A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil and good might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.
