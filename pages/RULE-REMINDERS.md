# Rule Reminders

## Spellcasting Material Components

- If you have an arcane focus or component pouch it is assumed you have any material components necessary for spellcasting **except if a material has a gp value**, in which case you must have that Material Component in your inventory to cast the spell.

## Combat

| Name                       | To Hit                    | Damage                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Unarmed Strike             | Strength Mod + Proficency | 1 + Strength Mod bludgeoning  |
| Improvised Weapon          | Strength Mod              | d4 + Strength Mod bludgeoning |
| Improvised Weapon (Thrown) | Dexterity Mod             | d4 bludgeoning                |

### Attack Replacements

- Shove
  - Contest: Strength (Athletics) vs Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
    - the target chooses the ability to use
  - Win: knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
  - Target must be no more than one size larger than you and within your reach
- Grapple
  - Contest: Strength (Athletics) vs Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
    - the target chooses the ability to use
  - Win: Target is grappled (move speed becomes 0)
  - Target must be no more than one size larger than you and within your reach
  - Involuntary movement of attacker or target out of reach will break the grapple (shove)
  - Moving with a grappled creature halves your speed unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
- Escape a grapple
  - Contest: Strength (Athletics) vs Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
    - the target chooses the ability to use
  - Win: Remove grappled condition
  
**HomeRule** All players may benefit from the 'Restrain' maneuver from the Grapple Feat

> You can use your action to try to pin a creature Grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are **both** *Restrained* until the grapple ends.

> **Restrained**:

> * A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
> * Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s Attack rolls have disadvantage.
> * The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws.

### Movement

- You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space
- Another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you
- Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t **willingly** end your move in its space
- A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it
  - Must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there
  - Disadvantage on Attack rolls and Dexterity Saving Throws
  - Attack rolls against the creature have advantage
- Overrun
  - Athletics Contest
  - Action or bonus action
  - Advantage if larger than target, disadvantage if smaller
- Tumble
  - Acrobatics Contest
  - Action or bonus action
  - Advantage if smaller than target, disadvantage if larger

## Out Of Combat

### Resting

> For the purposes of a short or long rest, rest is considered to be generally sedentiary actions that usually involve sitting, and doing nothing that requires intense focus.

- You regenerate all HP after a long rest, and up to ½ your maximum Hit Dice
- When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only ¼ of any expended Hit Dice (min 1).
- Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC10 CONSAV or suffer one level of exhaustion. It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest (-Xanathars)
- If you did not sleep on previous nights, or if you slept in medium or heavy armor, the rest **does not reduce your exhaustion level**.
- Long rests in some environments will only provide the benefit of a short rest. To get the benefit of a long rest, rest in an established or fortifiable position, or spend an entire day performing no travel or strenuous tasks.
