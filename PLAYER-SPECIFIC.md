# Player Specific

## Scott / Octavian, Wizard (Necromancer)

Old school necromancer, includes the magic of both death and life.

When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a wizard cantrip or a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a wizard spell for you.

## Ben / Zotri, Wizard (Necromancer)

New school necromancer.

### Animate Dead - 3rd lvl necromancy

- Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a humanoid, beast or undead within range.
- Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an Undead creature.
- The target becomes a Skeleton if you chose bones
  - Can use armor or weapons they could use before death
  - Creatures stats are modified: Int-5, Wis-3, Cha-6
- The target becomes a Zombie if you chose a corpse
  - Cannot use weapons
  - Creatures stats are modified: Int-8, Wis-3, Cha-6
  - Target gains the "Undead Fortitude" trait

> Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Owen / Asyet, Druid (Moon)

Can use Wild Shape a number of times equal to their proficency modifier, rather than a flat 2 until level 20. (Note: This may be broken AF at higher proficencies so may change at a later time)
